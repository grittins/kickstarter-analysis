# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
The purpose is to provide Louise a visualization and analysis on the campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the Launch Date a **pivot table** is created from the Kickstarter dataset to showcase the successful, failed and canceled outcomes in the Theatre Parent category. 

A line chart is then created to display the Outcomes based on the launch date.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
A table is created with column names as follows: 
  Goal	
  Number Successful	
  Number Failed	
  Number Canceled	
  Total Projects	
  Percentage Successful	
  Percentage Failed	
  Percentage Canceled
  
Formulas are used to extract the accurate values from the Kickstarter dataset in order to calculate the percentages. A line chart is then created to display the percentages of outcomes based on the different levels of goals.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The month of May has the most activities with the most successful outcomes as well. A steady decline in successful outcomes until September when it reached the usual level of successful outcomes and then hitting the lowest on December. 

However, May till August all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.  

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Although the outcomes based on goals is not proportionate we can conclude - as the goal kept increasing it became difficult to get a succesful campaign.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

There are some live event ongoing for which the results are not out yet. Those were not taken into account in order to complete this analysis. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

1) Numbers successful, failed, canceled based on Goals
2) Outcomes based on Launch date on a quarterly basis
